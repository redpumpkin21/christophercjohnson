            <p>This project came from working in GAâ€™s bootcamp. The project was made with React and Reactstap as my front end. I used Contentful as a way to hold my images so that I could populate them in my project. Contentful was tricky to implement in the front end due to the images being in a  separate part of the JSON in which I had to map in my api call to get all information in one place. </p>
