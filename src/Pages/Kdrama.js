                Group projects with one other person where 
                I tackled the front end with Angular and SASS.
                I used typescript as the javascript language and 
                set it up the front so that it auto-populates
                whenever more Kdramas are added to the back end. 
                MDBootstrap and NGBootstrap were used to implement 
                the carousel and the navbar.
